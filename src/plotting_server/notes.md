snaking paths, pattern growing on the screen
with a pre-defined sum over rectangular region

so let's pick 3 region

to demonstrate 4 of those pltos at the same time

4th one is the total

bottlenecked on the stage speed - in step scanning
in fly scanning

from streamdatum, from stomp serialization

from run engine serialization of the scan spec

JSON - serialized version of the scan spec
to turn back

summary at the bottom?

button to run again?

also show the raw image

then a faster camera - stages already can fly scanning

probably 5 frames every half a second = 10Hz

the snake frames are 100 by 100 maps likely

10Hz will be the fastest we can see enough light

but thne 10 minute scan?

2 minutes as expected duration

after clicking a button

we see a pixel with intensity

we histogram them in terms of maximum intensity

the initial pixels need to get dimmer

we update live the reference value

davidia - davidia shoudl already do the histogramming

the sum - numpy array?
